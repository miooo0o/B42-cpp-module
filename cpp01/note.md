#### Text Files vs. Binary Files:

Text Files: If you are working with plain text files (containing human-readable text), you generally don't need to use binary mode. Text mode (default mode) ensures that newline characters are handled appropriately for the platform (e.g., \n on Unix-like systems, \r\n on Windows).
Binary Files: If you are working with non-text files, such as images, audio, video, or other binary data, using binary mode is essential. Binary mode prevents any translation or modification of the data during reading or writing.
Line Endings:

When you read from a file in text mode, the newline characters may be translated based on the platform. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you are dealing with binary data that contains specific byte patterns.
In binary mode, newline characters are not translated, preserving the exact content of the file.
Character Encoding:

In text mode, the stream may perform character encoding/decoding based on the system's default encoding. For binary data, this can lead to corruption.
Binary mode ensures that characters are read and written as raw byte values, without encoding/decoding.
